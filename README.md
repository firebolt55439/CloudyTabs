## Installation

* [Download CloudyTabs 2.0](https://github.com/toddbluhm/CloudyTabs/releases/download/v2.0/CloudyTabs.dmg) and copy it to your Applications folder.

## Usage

To use CloudyTabs, open the app and select a tab from one of your devices. The tab's URL then opens it in your default browser (useful if like me, you use Safari on iOS and Chrome on OS X), Cmd(`⌘`)-Selecting a tab (or highlighting it and pressing Cmd(`⌘`)-Return(`⏎`)) opens the tab in the background. Opt(`⌥`)-Selecting a tab (or highlighting it and pressing Opt(`⌥`)-Return(`⏎`)) will copy the tab's URL.

Typing the first few letters or a tab's title will jump to that particular tab.

Hovering over the CloudyTabs menu bar icon displays a tooltip which lists the date that iCloud last updated the synced tabs `plist` (where CloudyTabs reads data from).

This version also contains fixes not merged in by original maintainer including:
- Added Reading List items (cl3m)
- Removed devices without open tabs (iMadden)

## Requirements

* OS X 10.8.2 or later
* An active iCloud account
